    "transcript": " Cooking the perfect steak is not always easy, but if you follow these tips I learned at culinary school, it'll be a whole lot easier. Today I'm using a beautiful thick cut New York strip. If you like it medium rare, the thicker the better. Next, give it a generous coating of salt and pepper all over from high above. Grab a good pan, get it nice and hot, then add some neutral oil and add the steak back cap down. Once the fat is rendered, rotate it onto its side. To get a beautiful even sear, apply some gentle even pressure. After a few minutes, take a peek and flip when it's a deep golden brown. Immediately add a knob of butter and some aromatics and begin basting the steak. To finish cooking it, transfer it into a 375 degree oven for five minutes or so. In the meantime, use the pan drippings to make a quick red wine pan sauce by sauteing some shallots, deglazing with red wine and once it's out, add some stock and reduce by 75%. Finish it off with cold butter and most importantly, rest the steak a few minutes so the juices don't run. Then you're ready to slice, admire the beautiful cook and plate and enjoy your steak.",
